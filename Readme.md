# Scores24 Scrapers and Telegram Bots

This repository contains robust Python scrapers for the **Bet Builder** and **Predictions** features of Scores24, along with Telegram bots built on top of those scrapers.

The project is designed to be modular, well documented, and easy to set up, whether you want to use only the scrapers or the full Telegram bots.

## How to use the Scrapers and Bots

Each scraper and bot has a slightly different setup, and detailed documentation is provided to ensure a smooth experience.

To use any scraper or bot, **you must read the README file inside its respective directory**. This is where you will find setup instructions, configuration details, and testing guidance.
