# Scores 24 Prediction's Scraper and Telegram bot script

Prediction directory of this repository contains strong python scraper that utilizes Scores24's exposed graphQL endpoint to fetch results from Predictions page and returns raw json data, which then can be used for various perposes, like I embeded the scraper in telegram bot script, so now it can ask users for filters and fetch raw json based on those filters and return structured Prediction slips.

This was just an overview, this readme will dive you through the directory structure, scraper and bot's testing process along with how they work on a core level.
